		mcp.WithDescription("This is an Experimental method. This method searches for eBay items based on a image and retrieves summaries of the items. You pass in a Base64 image in the request payload and can refine the search by category, or eBay product ID (ePID), or a combination of these using URI parameters. To get the Base64 image string, you can use sites such as https://codebeautify.org/image-to-base64-converter. This method also supports the following: Filtering by the value of one or multiple fields, such as listing format, item condition, price range, location, and more. For the fields supported by this method, see the filter parameter. Filtering by item aspects using the aspect_filter parameter. For details and examples of these capabilities, see Browse API in the Buying Integration Guide. Pagination and sort controls There are pagination controls (limit and offset fields) and sort query parameters that control/sort the data that is returned. By default, the results are sorted by &quot;Best Match&quot;. For more information about Best Match, see the eBay help page Best Match. URLs for this method Production URL: https://api.ebay.com/buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search_by_image/ Sandbox URL: Due to the data available, this method is not supported in the eBay Sandbox. To test your integration, use the Production URL. Request headers This method uses the X-EBAY-C-ENDUSERCTX request header to support revenue sharing for eBay Partner Networks and to improve the accuracy of shipping and delivery time estimations. For details see, Request headers in the Buying Integration Guide. URL Encoding for Parameters Query parameter values need to be URL encoded. For details, see URL encoding query parameter values. For readability, code examples in this document have not been URL encoded. Restrictions This method can return a maximum of 10,000 items. For a list of supported sites and other restrictions, see API Restrictions. eBay Partner Network: In order to receive a commission for your sales, you must use the URL returned in the itemAffiliateWebUrl field to forward your buyer to the ebay.com site."),

For example, the method below uses the category ID for Women's Clothing. This will return only items for a woman's red shirt. category_ids=15724&amp;aspect_filter=categoryId:15724,Color:{Red} Required: The category ID is required twice; once as a URI parameter and as part of the aspect_filter.

The list of eBay category IDs is not published and category IDs are not the same across all the eBay marketplaces. You can use the following techniques to find a category by site: Use the Category Changes page. Use the Taxonomy API. For details see Get Categories for Buy APIs.

In GB, it is the Charity Registration Number (CRN), commonly called &quot;Charity Number&quot;. To find the charities eBay supports, you can search for a charity at Charity Search or go to Charity Shop. To find the charity ID of a specific charity, click on a charity and use the EIN number. For example, the charity ID for American Red Cross, is 530196605. You can also use any combination of the category_Ids and q fields with a charity_Ids to filter the result set. This gives you additional control over the result set. Restriction: This is supported only on the US and GB marketplaces. Maximum: 20 IDs Required: One ID")),

The other values return data that can be used to create histograms or provide additional information. Valid Values: ASPECT_REFINEMENTS - This returns the aspectDistributions container, which has the dominantCategoryId, matchCount, and refinementHref for the various aspects of the items found. For example, if you searched for 'Mustang', some of the aspect would be Model Year, Exterior Color, Vehicle Mileage, etc. Note: ASPECT_REFINEMENTS are category specific. BUYING_OPTION_REFINEMENTS - This returns the buyingOptionDistributions container, which has the matchCount and refinementHref for AUCTION and FIXED_PRICE (Buy It Now) items. Note: Classified items are not supported and only &quot;Buy It Now&quot; (non-auction) items are returned. CATEGORY_REFINEMENTS - This returns the categoryDistributions container, which has the categories that the item is in. CONDITION_REFINEMENTS - This returns the conditionDistributions container, such as NEW, USED, etc. Within these groups are multiple states of the condition. For example, New can be New without tag, New in box, New without box, etc. EXTENDED - This returns the shortDescription field, which provides condition and item aspect information and the itemLocation.city field. MATCHING_ITEMS - This is meant to be used with one or more of the refinement values above. You use this to return the specified refinements and all the matching items. FULL - This returns all the refinement containers and all the matching items. Code so that your app gracefully handles any future changes to this list. Default: MATCHING_ITEMS")),
